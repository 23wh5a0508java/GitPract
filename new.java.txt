What is Routing?
Rouing is web development refers to how an application navigates between one components to another component
in react rouing helps manage navigation using spa(single page application) feature 
like without reloading the complete page 
it will load the component whatever we call for


in this routing we are going to use 4 diff tags
link tag: used to create navigation links btw diff routes without refreshing the page 
BrowserRoute : which enable the routing 
Routes: it works as container to hold all the routes
Route :used to define a path  and component that should be rendered then the path matches to the URL
